<P>You know watching a movie that is great but not just quite perfect as you'd want it to be? Well this was and still is the only perfect film I have ever seen. The atmospheric soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is beautifully done. The story and characters are absolutely the best you can make them. The CGI in the film is top notch as is the acting. This film is just perfect as it can't get any better than it is. Bravo Nolan. I will never again see a movie as good as this one I am 99.99% sure. The only .01% of positivity is if Nolan himself manages to top this one.

<P>I couldn't believe "The Dark knight" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. "The Dark Knight" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.

<P>As for the story, some of the "inspirations" are so huge and so obvious that mentioning two or three of them would REALLY ruin the movie for you, and I'm not willing to do that. Lots of mysticism and ecology, if you like that stuff. If you're 15 or so, you'll have a great time thinking that it's the first time somebody makes something like this. If you're an experienced movie watcher, better leave your skepticism at the door, bring lots of pop corn and enjoy with the usual action-flick-with-moral-and-loads-of-clich√©s.
